OsmoSYS (Overly simpe MongoDB System)
=====================================

Just a little RESTful Service to store and recieve Objects from & to a mongodb.
The server_small.js shows that you actually just need a few lines of code to make this working.

With some "comfort"-Functions for error handling like in server.js its still almost nothing.
